    "To enable users to calculate a variety of graph metrics for their linked data, Splink provides the `compute_graph_metrics()` method.\n",

If this information is available to Splink then it will be passed automatically, otherwise the user will have to provide it themselves and take care to ensure that threshold values align.\n",
    "\n",
